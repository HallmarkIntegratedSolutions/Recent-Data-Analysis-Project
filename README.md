This is one of the recent project analysed by Hallmark Solutions 
# Project Topic: Investigation of gastrointestinal helminths of Anura Hoplobatrachus occipatalis and Amietophyrynus maculata. 

## Project Objectives
---
- determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal helminths in Anura Hoplobatrachus occipatalis and Amietophyrynus maculata populations in relation to sex in the study area.
- identify the species diversity of gastrointestinal helminths in Anura Hoplobatrachus occipatalis and Amietophyrynus maculata in the study area.
- investigate the abundance and prevalence of gastrointestinal helminths in Anura Hoplobatrachus occipatalis and Amietophyrynus maculata in relation to the body organs.
-determine the monthly abundance and prevalence of Anura Hoplobatrachus occipatalis and Amietophyrynus maculata in the study area.

## Data Source
---
180 anurans representing two species (Hoplobatrachus occipatalis and Amietophyrynus maculata) used in this study were collected during a six (6) months biotic survey of three freshwater bodies: Elemi river, Omisanjana river and Olotoro water pool in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State.

## Data Analysis Results
---
- There exist no significant difference in the overall occurrence and prevalence of anurans in the study area (F=0.897, p>0.05)
- There is a significant difference in the prevalence of anurans in relation to habitat (=10.035, p<0.05)
- There is no significant difference in the prevalence of infection of anurans in relation to sex
- There is no significant difference in the prevalence of infection of anurans in relation to parasite specie (=2.708, p>0.05).
- There exist no significant difference in the overall occurrence and prevalence of anurans in relation to months (F=2.638, p<0.05).
- There is no significant difference in the prevalence of anurans in relation to organs (F=254.305, p<0.05).

## Conclusion
